-css [filename]
	Embed contents of file [filename] as a CSS stylesheet in output

-f [filename]
	The file [filename] is the file for which you are generating a blog
	preview.

-stx
	Don't open a browser window with the fully-prepared blog preview. 
	Instead, open a text-editor window with a partially processed file in
	which the hypertexting shortcodes have been processed but which
	otherwise remains identical to the original source code. (When you
	finally are ready to post your article, use the output generated by
	this option as the source from which you do the copy/paste.)

--help
