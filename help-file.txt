-cln
	Clear this command's cache-directory before generating the preview
	file. (Make sure you at least invoke this option once in a while,
	or else a lot of expired stuff will accumulate -- and you really
	shouldn't need to keep anything in this cache for long-term
	reference, as if anything it should be the source-file that should
	serve that purpose.)

-css [filename]
	Embed contents of file [filename] as a CSS stylesheet in output

-f [filename]
	The file [filename] is the file for which you are generating a blog
	preview.

-stx
	Don't open a browser window with the fully-prepared blog preview. 
	Instead, open a text-editor window with a partially processed file in
	which the hypertexting shortcodes have been processed but which
	otherwise remains identical to the original source code. (When you
	finally are ready to post your article, use the output generated by
	this option as the source from which you do the copy/paste.)

--help
	Display this help message.
