<tr><td class = "cname">dctitle</td>
<td class = "etype">span</td>
<td class = "expln">
This class highlights the name of a book, a movie, of another article,
of another blog, etcetera.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">excrp_attrib</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
This element, which is within a <span class = "clsrf">excrp_frame</span> element,
contains one line of attribution of a section of quoted text.
For example, the first element of this type in a <span class = "clsrf">excrp_frame</span> may
specify the name by which the person to whom the passage is attributed to is known,
and the next element of this type may name the work from which the passage is taken.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">excrp_frame</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
This element covers both the content and attribution of
a quoted passage of text.
<br/><br/>
The contents of this element are one <span class = "clsrf">excrp_main</span>
element, followed by one-or-more <span class = "clsrf">excrp_attrib</span> elements.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">excrp_main</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
This element, which is within a <span class = "clsrf">excrp_frame</span> element,
contains the actual content of a quoted passage of text.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_cont_beginning</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
For segmented articles (that is, those that use <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span>)
the first section of the article may be a special section that has no title besides
that of the whole article. This class covers that section.
<br/><br/>
It must be noted that <span class = "crucial">this class does not cover the precap - but
strictly covers a section that is within the <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span> section</span>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_cont_divided</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
This class covers everything in the <span class = "clsrf">my_fullcont</span>
section <em>except</em> for what is in the <span class = "clsrf">my_precap</span>
section -- but <span class = "crucial">only in articles that are segmented - that is,
articles that are divided into smaller segments, each with their own title</span>.
<br/><br/>
The equivalent class for articles that are not segmented is <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_undivided</span>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_cont_undivided</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
For an article that has is not divided into segments, this class is used
instead of <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_em_words</td>
<td class = "etype">span</td>
<td class = "expln">
This class highlights a word or phrase that is stressed <em>within</em> a sentence.
Some literati have the view that it is unbecoming of a writer to enshrine in
writing this aspect of language --- no matter how much it can completely change
the meaning of a sentence in spoken language.
Anyone who follows this rule will probably not use this element.
<br/><br/>
However - while the view of this literati is to be respected with regards to those who
choose to follow it -- it shouldn't be enforced on those who dissent from it.
For this reason, this style class should still be defined.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_fullcont</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
This class surrounds the entire textual content of the article.
No - it does not surround the blog-tags - nor does it surround the title --
but surrounds everything that gets inserted as the article text -- including the precap.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_keypoint</td>
<td class = "etype">span</td>
<td class = "expln">
This class highlights a section of text that must be especially stressed.
For example -- it can highlight a sentence describing a concept that the
author is specifically concerned about the reader overlooking.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">my_precap</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
At the beginning of the <span class = "clsrf">my_fullcont</span> section will generally
be an opening summary of what the article is about -- so that readers can decide whether
or not this article is one that they want to focus on. This class covers that section.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">rt_note_box</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
This element highlights a note about the article itself - specifically about
it's publication history.
For example - if a crucial thing in the article has been changed since
it's original publication, it may be desired to insert a note of this kind
to this effect.
<br/><br/>
For another example, if an article is cross-posted on multiple blogs,
each location of the article may have an element of this type after the
<span class = "clsrf">my_precap</span> but be fore
<span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span> or the
<span class = "clsrf">my_cont_undivided</span> pointing to the other
locations of the article (one of the few occasions when it is okay
to have something other than <span class = "clsrf">my_precap</span>,
<span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span>, or <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_undivided</span>
directly within the <span class = "clsrf">my_fullcont</span> element).
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">sect_a</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
In segmented articles (that is, those that use <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span>)
this class covers an entire regular segment of the article (that is, any segment
within the <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span> except for the <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_beginning</span>).
<br/><br/>
This class covers the entire segment -- both the segment-title and the segment-text.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">sect_b</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
Within a <span class = "clsrf">sect_a</span> segment - this class covers only the content part of the segment -- that is, everything <em>except</em> for the title.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class = "cname">sect_h</td>
<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
Within a <span class = "clsrf">sect_a</span> segment - this class covers only the title of the segment. (Needless to say, this part must come before the <span class = "clsrf">sect_b</span> part.)

In the output of this program - every &lt;a&gt; tag with an "href" value
will also have a "target" value of "_blank" so that the link will automatically open
in a separate window or tab - allowing the reader to more easily return
to the current article after reading whatever has been referenced - and
without loosing place.
<br/><br/>
If the link leads to an article, video, or other such resource
that is frowned upon, but still must be linked to for the sake
of reference -- then the tag will also contain a "rel" field
with a value of "nofollow".
The reason for that is detailed in the blog article who's URL follows:
