For segmented articles (that is, those that use <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span>)
the first section of the article may be a special section that has no title besides
that of the whole article. This class covers that section.
<br/><br/>
It must be noted that <span class = "crucial">this class does not cover the precap - but
strictly covers a section that is within the <span class = "clsrf">my_cont_divided</span> section</span>.

This class covers everything in the <span class = "clsrf">my_fullcont</span>
section <em>except</em> for what is in the <span class = "clsrf">my_precap</span>
section -- but <span class = "crucial">only in articles that are segmented - that is,
articles that are divided into smaller segments, each with their own title</span>.

This class surrounds the entire textual content of the article.
No - it does not surround the blog-tags - nor does it surround the title --
but surrounds everything that gets inserted as the article text -- including the precap.

<td class = "etype">div</td>
<td class = "expln">
At the beginning of the <span class = "clsrf">my_fullcont</span> section will generally
be an opening summary of what the article is about -- so that readers can decide whether
or not this article is one that they want to focus on. This class covers that section.
